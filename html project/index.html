        <h3><span>Web Designing :</span></h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
            undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
            ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
        <h3><span>Web Development :</span></h3>
        <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
            interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
            in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham</p>
        <h3><span>Private Software Designing :</span></h3>
        <p>Some VOCs are responsible for Ozone production in lower atmosphere at the ground level .Ozone
            at ground level is quite harmful, producing cracks in rubber, destroying plants, and causing respiratory
            distress and eye irritation in humans. These effects set in at quite low concentrations, around 100ppb.The
            naturally produced ozone in upper troposphere is useful for life as it prevent us from harmful ultra violet
            radiations however, some man-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) are harmful to this protective
            ozone layer.The CFC’s are emitted from air conditioners, regrigerators, aerosols sparays etc </p>

        <p>It is made of Platinum and Rhodium.The exhaust gases are first sent over the reduction
        catalyst.It conver oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) to Nitrogen (N₂) and Oxygen (O₂).The following reaction take
        place when the exhaust pass over the reduction catalyst.</p>
